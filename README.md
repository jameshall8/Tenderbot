# Tenderbot
Tenderbot slack bot for webscraping tenders and posting into slack channel. This bot also offers a few interactivity features (e.g getting further information regarding tenders)

This app was originally pushed to the HiveIT github, however, I decided to repush it here for people to view.

I was originally running the function application and table storage using azurite locally, once I had fully developed the system, I used azure to host the timmer trigger function along with 
the HTTP trigger for the interactivity aspect of the app.

This was an incredibly fun application to create, thanks to HiveIT for having me as an intern and allowing me to develop something they use day in day out!
